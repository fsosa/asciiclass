The data_matcher.rb script requires Ruby 1.9.2 and higher to run. 
It also requires the "levenshtein-ffi" gem: a fast Levenshtein library in C ported as a Ruby extension. 
You can install this simply by typing in "gem install levenshtein-ffi" (https://rubygems.org/gems/levenshtein-ffi)

You can run the script with ruby ("ruby ./data_matcher.rb ARGS") or chmod +x the script and run it as "./data_matcher.rb ARG".
